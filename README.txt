Question 1:

To generate all plots for question 1 (a, b, and c) run Question1.m for a desired probability
eg. "Question1(0.1)"

Question 2:

To generate the plot for question 2 run Question2.m with a number of tries
eg. "Question2(20)"
This will run a modular network constructed with a random probability between 0.1 and 0.5 for 60 seconds
and repeat this procedure 20 times. Then, for each run, the neural complexity of the network is calculated
and plotted.
