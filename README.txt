Question 1:

To generate all plots for question 1 (a, b, and c) run Question1.m for a desired probability
eg. "Question1(0.1)"

Question 2:

To generate the plot for question 2 run Question2.m with a number of tries
eg. "Question2(20)"

This will run a modular network constructed with a random probability 
between 0.1 and 0.5 for 60 seconds and repeat this procedure teh given 
number of times. Then, for each run, the neural complexity of the network 
is calculated and plotted. 
In creating the submitted plot, we ran this simulation for 50 tries.
